Rent bandwidth for money

In today's world, high-speed internet is life. It can definitely be endlessly frustrating to watch loading bar creep by, waiting for a large file to download, and whether you manage to download that application or project on time can mean life or death to your grades.

Hence, we aim to bring to you high download speeds for your largest of files, and on the other hand, allow others the opportunity to share their excess bandwidth for a small profit. No longer will you need to wait hours on end to download a large application, and neither will you have to hunt for a good torrent for that particular file you are looking for - with Zeus, you can choose the file you wish to 'torrent', and seeders who register for this application will share download parts of the large file, then simultaneously upload the parts to the user such that the user can download the large file at five, ten, even more than twenty times faster than the usual speed.

With just a few cents, Zeus can make your life faster, easier and happier.

##Testing
The system consists of Webserver, Leecher, and Seeders. The Webserver runs in an Electron window. Leecher is a webpage at the IP of the Webserver, at port 3000. Seeder runs in an Electron window and multiple instances must be run on different computers. In this example, the Webserver and Leecher are on the same computer.
